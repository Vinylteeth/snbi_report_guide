                  Terminal joints are designed to accommodate thermal movements of integral and semi-integral abutments by allowing expansion to occur between the approach slabs
                  and the approach pavement. Terminal joints are only required for integral or semi-integral bridges.

                <p>
                  Previous terminal joint design details for Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (PCCP) used 2 feet of asphalt at the ends of the approach, and there was no design
                  detail for HMA pavement adjacent to bridges with approach slabs having integral or semi-integral abutments. Both cases have proven problematic, so to improve
                  functionality, new terminal joint design details were introduced in September 2019 with Design Memo 19-10, RSP 503-R-692, and RPD 503-R-692d (now E 503-BATJ
                  series).

                  Use destructive or non-destructive testing results or visual condition indicators of materials covering the surfaces being assessed when top, underside or both
                  surfaces are not visible for assessment. Past inspection reports and repair records may also provide supplemental information to aid in the determination of the
                  condition rating.

                <p>
                  Do not consider the condition of non-monolithic wearing surfaces (i.e. overlays), stay-in-place deck forms, joint assemblies, expansion devices, bridge rails, or
                  scuppers when determining the condition rating code for this item, except insofar as they indicate the condition of the deck itself.

                <p>
                  Consider the condition of a joint header only when the deck serves as a joint header. For bridges with integral decks/top flanges (e.g. rigid frames, decked
                  girders or tee beams, voided slab beams, box girders, etc.), the deck condition may affect the superstructure condition rating; however, the superstructure
                  condition does not affect the deck condition rating.

                <br />

                  Consider primary load carrying members when determining the condition rating code for this item, which includes cross-frames and diaphragms for curved girder
                  bridges. Consider secondary members only if they adversely impact the primary members. Visual assessments may be supplemented with non-destructive or destructive
                  testing results.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>The superstructure includes:</p>

                  <li>members above the bearings for bridges with non-integral superstructure and substructure;</li>
                  <li>girders/beams for integral superstructures;</li>
                  <li>members above the spring line for arch bridges;</li>
                  <li>slabs of concrete rigid frame bridges; and</li>
                  <li>legs, knees and girders for concrete and steel rigid K-Frame or Delta-Frame bridges.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>Consider the condition of integral headwalls and wingwalls to the first expansion joint.</p>

                <p>
                  Do not consider the condition of bearings when determining the condition rating code for this item except to the extent that the bearings are causing distress in
                  the superstructure.

                <br />
                <p>
                  Do not consider the condition of protective coating systems when determining the condition rating code for this item except to the extent that problems with the
                  protective coating system are indicative of problems with the underlying superstructure material. A well-formed patina on weathering steel is considered a
                  protective coating and is not considered a defect.

                  Superstructure types without substructures may be affected by scour. When observed conditions are not consistent with the scour design or the assumptions used in
                  the scour appraisal, scour is considered when reporting the code for this item. In this case, observed conditions also indicate a need to reevaluate Item B.AP.03
                  (Scour Vulnerability). Observed scour that is less than the tolerable limit determined in the scour appraisal does not affect this item.

                  <li>buried pipe or box;</li>
                  <li>footings below the walls of a 3-sided box; and</li>
                  <li>foundation piles exposed by erosion or scour.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                <p>
                  When observed conditions are not consistent with the scour design or the assumptions used in the scour appraisal, scour is considered in the coding of this item.
                  In this case, observed conditions also indicate a need to reevaluate Item B.AP.03 (Scour Vulnerability). Observed scour that is less than the tolerable limit
                  determined in the scour appraisal does not affect this item.

                  Evaluate the condition and effectiveness of channel protection devices installed on banks or in the stream to mitigate channel issues that may impact the bridge.
                  When reporting this item, consider erosion and scour, damage (unraveling, displacement, separation, and sagging), and material defects (scaling, abrasion,

                <p>The intent of this item is to report the status and vulnerability determination from scour appraisals required by the NBIS.</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  The codes for this item are based on the appraised scour vulnerability as described in HEC-18, Evaluating Scour at Bridges; HEC-23, Bridge Scour and Stream
                  Instability Countermeasures; and HEC-20, Stream Stability at Highway Structures.

                <p>Scour appraisals are typically performed by a multidisciplinary team of hydraulic, geotechnical, and structural engineers (Scour Appraisal Team).</p>
                <br />

                <p>FHWA Hydraulic Technical Advisories, manuals, and software can be found in the link below.</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Refer to item B.C.11 (Scour Condition Rating) in the Component Condition Ratings subsection to address field observed scour conditions and the effect on bridge
                  components.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Use code B when designed, installed, and functioning countermeasures are used to address potential scour and to maintain bridge stability for new or existing
                  bridges, or bridges with unknown foundations.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Use code B when the Scour Appraisal Team determines that the in-place, non-designed countermeasures are fully functioning and are appropriate to mitigate the risk
                  of scour.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>Use code C for bridges that could become unstable for the potential scour, and temporary countermeasures are installed that were not designed.</p>

                <p>An overtopping occurrence is when the waterway overtops the riding surface carried on the bridge.</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  Bridge overtopping likelihood, since the year built (B.W.01), is typically determined from historical bridge inspection or maintenance records, hydraulic studies,
                  local residents/landowners, and/or site indicators including highwater marks on the bridge or its surroundings, debris remains on bridge upper members, etc.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  For newer bridges with limited historical inspection or maintenance information, hydraulic design information can be used to establish an overtopping likelihood.
